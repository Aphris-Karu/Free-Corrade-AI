This is a terminal based brain used in testing.

Create a directory, place this script in the directory. Create a subdirectory called "brain" to hold the rive scripts.

Then run the script and it will prompt you. Type your line and the brain will reply.

The script will put "SecondLife Resident:" infront of your sentence as this is the expected format for messages
